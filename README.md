# Youth Coding League

The Gilliam County Public Library has organized two Youth Coding League teams - one for the Grade 5/6 division, and one for the Grade 7/8 division.

The coaches are [Deanna Campbell (deanna.campbell@co.gilliam.or.us)](mailto:deanna.campbell@co.gilliam.or.us), and [Josh Hendricks (joshooaj@pm.me)](mailto:joshooaj@pm.me).

We will be meeting up at the library, except during the closure between January 27th and February 1st.

## Parents, keep in touch!

We have created a class on Remind.com as a way to keep in touch. It is available as an app, and through their website. Please join us there to stay up to date!

## Updates

### 2025-01-24

We will meet at the library today after school. Coach Josh will be there from 3:30pm to 5pm.

We are currently working on Sprint 1 which is a two-week sprint. Your students' projects will be due on or before Friday, January 31st.

We need to receive signed name/photo release forms for about half of our kids. You are not required to grant permission to release your child's name or photo, but
the form is still required to be signed and returned for our records. If you do not want to release your child's name and/or photo, do not initial those options.

## FAQ

### Can students work from home?

Yes! If you have a computer, laptop, or a tablet at home, your student(s) can login at [www.youthcodingleague.com/](https://www.youthcodingleague.com/coders/login)
at any time! They are _not_ required to complete their work exclusively at the library.

Your student(s) received a username and password, and we can send it to you if it has been lost. Email [Josh Hendricks (joshooaj@pm.me)](mailto:joshooaj@pm.me) to
request your student's login details.

### What language are students using? What are the projects like?

Students will be learning the Scratch programming language. Programming in Scratch is done in a web browser and uses a visual "block-based" language. It's a great
way to be introduced to core programming concepts like variables, functions, events, conditionals, and loops which are used universally in all programming languages.

During the first sprint, Grade 5/6 students will create a project with a character who shares 3-4 facts about the history of space exploration. The theme for the
season is "Space"!

Grade 7/8 students are sharing their favorite game, and at least three things they like about it. The theme of the season for this division is "Gaming"!

## Terminology

### Sprint

The term "sprint" is used in software development to describe a fixed period of time - usually 2-4 weeks. During "sprint planning", team members are assigned tasks to
complete during the sprint, and the goal is to complete everything before the sprint ends.

In the YCL, all sprints are one week, except for the first sprint which is two weeks. During each sprint, students will...

- Watch a few required videos
- Complete that sprint's tasks in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
- Optionally complete up to 3 add-ons (think "extra credit")
- Answer a few questions, and submit their projects
